# ML based Terrain Detection

Monitoring and analyzing terrain changes is essential for proactive disaster
management, particularly in regions vulnerable to natural calamities. This
project utilizes advanced machine learning techniques to detect anomalies
and physical changes in terrain by integrating high-resolution satellite data
from CartoSat-1 DEM, accessed through the BHUVAN platform developed
by the Indian Space Research Organization (ISRO). The system applies the
Isolation Forest algorithm, a robust anomaly detection method, to slope and
elevation data for efficient identification of unusual terrain patterns that may
signal risks like landslides or flooding. Data preprocessing steps, including
slope calculations and data augmentation, improve model accuracy and
adaptability, making the system effective even with lower-quality or variable
data. Furthermore, the project introduces optimization strategies such as
parallel processing, adaptive algorithm configurations, and real-time data
integration, enhancing processing speed and scalability for large datasets. By
focusing on corrected images and automating anomaly detection, the system
simplifies interpretability and delivers actionable insights into disaster-prone
areas. This approach not only advances machine learning applications in
geospatial analysis but also supports the development of preventive measures
by providing an early warning framework for terrain monitoring, aiding
disaster readiness and environmental resilience.
